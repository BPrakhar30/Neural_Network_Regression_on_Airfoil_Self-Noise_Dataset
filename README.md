**Neural Network Regression on Airfoil Self-Noise Dataset**

**Introduction**

This project involves the development of a neural network model to perform regression analysis on the Airfoil Self-Noise dataset. The goal is to predict the scaled sound pressure level based on various features related to airfoil shapes. This README provides an overview of the project structure, including dataset implementation, model development, and evaluation.

**Dataset Overview**

The Airfoil Self-Noise dataset consists of several features related to airfoil shapes, such as frequency, angle of attack, chord length, free-stream velocity, and suction side displacement thickness. The target variable is the scaled sound pressure level. This dataset allows for an exploration of the relationship between airfoil characteristics and the noise they produce.

**Implementation Details**

Data Preprocessing: The notebook includes a custom dataset object implementation for loading and preprocessing the Airfoil Self-Noise dataset. The first five columns are treated as features, and the last column is considered the target.

Neural Network Model: A neural network architecture is designed and implemented to predict the scaled sound pressure level from the given features. The model's structure, including the number of layers and activation functions, is specified within the notebook.

Training and Evaluation: The notebook details the training process, including loss function selection, optimizer configuration, and evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the application of neural networks to solve a regression problem in the domain of aerodynamics. By accurately predicting the scaled sound pressure level based on airfoil characteristics, the model contributes valuable insights into the factors influencing airfoil self-noise.
